#Deglatix-IoT
Mobile app for Higrow monitoring
I used low cost Higrow plant monitoring sensor, which gives reading of four (04) environmental parameters: DHT11 Temperature and Humidity, soil moisture as well as light intensity, it can also easily communicate
through WiFi network for cloud sharing data on IoT platform "Thingspeak" also his data is used to develop android mobile app "Deglatix IoT".
Tha app is developed using android studio.
Data collected from sensors is uploaded on the cloud with ThingSpeak public channels.
the app collect data from sensors and upload it on this channels, it allows to farmers for remote monitoring of their DP fields on real time as well.
